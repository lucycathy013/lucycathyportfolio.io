									<p>Hello, I'm <strong>LUCY JOSEPH</strong>, a Computer Technology graduate (Class of 2024) with a growing passion for data science 
                                        and artificial intelligence. My academic background gave me a strong grounding in computing fundamentals, 
                                        but it was curiosity — about how data and intelligence shape our world — that set me on my current path.</p>

									<p>Along the way, I've built a foundation that connects three areas: <strong>Networking</strong>, <strong>Data</strong>, and <strong>AI</strong>. 
                                        Through Cisco certifications, I learned the importance of secure and structured systems — how connections make technology reliable. 
                                    </p>
                                </div>
                                        <!-- Bottom part: Full-width paragraph -->
                                 <div class="inner">

                                        <P>From there, I dove into the world of data and AI through programs like <strong>WithYouWithMe's DATA</strong> 
                                        and <strong>Oracle's AI Foundations and Generative AI certifications</strong>, 
                                        where I began exploring how data fuels intelligent systems.</p>

                                </div>
                                         <!-- Bottom part: Full-width paragraph -->
                                 <div class="inner">

									<p>Today, I'm focused on developing my data analysis and AI skills through self-driven projects, 
                                        continuous learning, and experimentation. My goal is to grow into a data professional who can build solutions that are not only smart, 
                                        but also secure and meaningful.</p>

									<p>This portfolio represents that journey — a place to share what I'm learning, the projects I'm building, 
                                        and the direction I'm heading.</p>
